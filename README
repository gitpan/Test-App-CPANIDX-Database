VERSION
    version 0.04

SYNOPSIS
      use strict;
      use warnings;

      use Test::App::CPANIDX::Database;

      # Create a test database in the current working directory

      my $tdb = Test::App::CPANIDX::Database->new();

      # Get the name of the test database file generated

      my $dbfile = $tdb->dbfile;

      # The test database will be automagically removed when the 
      # object goes out of scope.

DESCRIPTION
    Test::App::CPANIDX::Database will generate a test database for use with
    App::CPANIDX deriatives.

    It generates a very simple DBD::SQLite database which contains a single
    CPAN author "FOOBAR", a single distribution "Foo-Bar-0.01.tar.gz" and a
    single module "Foo::Bar".

CONSTRUCTOR
    "new"
        Generates a test database called "cpanidx.db" and returns an object
        reference.

        Without any parameters this database file will be located in the
        current working directory and will be automatically removed when the
        object falls out of scope.

        You may provide parameters to affect this behaviour.

        "unlink"
            Set this to a false value to disable the automatic removal of
            the test database file.

              my $tdb = Test::App::CPANIDX::Database->new( unlink => 0 );

        "dir"
            Set this to an existing directory path where the database file
            should be created.

              my $tdb = Test::App::CPANIDX::Database->new( dir => '/some/funky/path' );

METHODS
    "dbfile"
        Returns the name of the database file that was generated.
